In config.sh file select linux kernel version and TOP directory of the project.
Available kernels:
    5.3.1
    5.6.4

If the desired kernels version is older than the current one, in order to be
able to select newly installed kernel, set GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE as menu.
In order to do this, open grub file:
sudo vim /etc/default/grub
and modify GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE entry:
GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE="menu"

Download, compile and install kernel:
/bin/bash install_all.sh

Reboot. If necessary, select new kernel.

Check how the controller works:
/bin/bash play.sh

In case of not having installed all required python tools, install_tools.sh
script can be used:
/bin/bash install_tools.sh
